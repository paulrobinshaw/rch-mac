# Useful Prompts

## Explain to a non-technical stakeholder

> You are a technical writer explaining a new developer tool to a smart but non-technical stakeholder (e.g., a product manager or founder). Read PLAN.md and README.md, then produce a clear, jargon-free explanation covering:
>
> 1. **What problem does this solve?** (in one paragraph a non-developer would understand)
> 2. **How does it work?** (the mental model — use an analogy if it helps)
> 3. **Why should anyone care?** (what's the value proposition — who benefits and how)
> 4. **What makes it different from just running Xcode normally?**
> 5. **What's the current state and what's left to build?**
>
> Avoid: acronyms without explanation, implementation details, JSON field names, config syntax. Write as if the reader has never used a terminal.
