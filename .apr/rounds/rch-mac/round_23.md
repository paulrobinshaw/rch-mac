# APR Round 23 — Final Reconciliation

## Status: CONVERGED ✅

## Line counts
- PLAN.md: 1123 lines
- README.md: 251 lines
- IMPLEMENTATION.md: 162 lines (157 after patch)
- Total: 1536 lines (1531 after patch)

## Patch applied
- IMPLEMENTATION.md: Removed 5 duplicate lines (48-52) where destination resolver and state artifacts bullets appeared twice — once with broken/empty formatting, once correctly. The correct versions (lines 53-57) were retained.

## Consistency check

### Cross-document alignment
- **Milestones (M0-M7)**: PLAN.md defines scope, IMPLEMENTATION.md maps to build order, README.md references correctly. ✅
- **Artifact list**: All three docs list the same artifacts. PLAN.md is normative, README echoes, IMPLEMENTATION references. ✅
- **CLI surface**: PLAN.md defines commands, README documents them for operators, IMPLEMENTATION scopes them to milestones. ✅
- **Backend strategy**: xcodebuild=MVP (M2), XcodeBuildMCP=M3, no auto-fallback. Consistent across all three. ✅
- **Failure taxonomy + exit codes**: PLAN.md normative table, IMPLEMENTATION references, README omits (appropriate). ✅
- **Protocol**: RPC envelope, binary framing, version negotiation — PLAN.md defines, IMPLEMENTATION maps to M1.5/M2. ✅
- **Config precedence**: Identical 4-layer merge order in all three docs. ✅
- **Classifier**: Deny-by-default, same allowed/denied actions across all docs. ✅
- **Destination resolver**: Added in round 22 to M2 scope in IMPLEMENTATION.md, matches PLAN.md spec. ✅
- **State artifacts**: Added in round 22 to M2 scope, matches PLAN.md run/job state machine. ✅
- **Schema IDs**: Consistent naming convention (rch-xcode/<artifact>@1) across PLAN.md artifact schemas. ✅

### Internal consistency
- PLAN.md: Self-consistent. Schema tables match artifact list. Failure kinds match exit codes. State machine aligns with lifecycle. ✅
- README.md: Non-normative, correctly defers to PLAN.md. No contradictions. ✅
- IMPLEMENTATION.md: Build order is logical (M0→M7). Component map matches architecture. Post-MVP correctly deferred. ✅

## Readiness assessment
**READY FOR IMPLEMENTATION** 🚀

The spec is complete, internally consistent, and well-structured for incremental delivery:
1. M0 (worker connectivity) has no spec dependencies — can start immediately
2. M1 (classifier) is self-contained with clear test fixtures
3. M1.5 (mock worker) enables all subsequent integration testing
4. M2 (MVP execution) is the critical path — all normative protocol/artifact specs are defined
5. M3-M7 are clean extensions with no spec gaps

No further reconciliation rounds needed.
